# Call_Centre_Dashboard #
In this mini project I used a dataset and built a dashboard using Excel with different charts and filters to visualize the data.

Link to the dataset: https://data.world/markbradbourne/rwfd-real-world-fake-data/workspace/file?filename=Call+Center.csv

# Data Preparation #

Duplicated the dataset for preservation
Ensured that columns were transformed into their appropriate data types
Applied formatting to differentiate headers from the rest of the data


# Data Visualization #
Generated pivot tables for better data analysis
Designed charts corresponding to each pivot table
Implemented slicers to facilitate data filtering
