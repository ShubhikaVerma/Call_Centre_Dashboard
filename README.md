# Call_Centre_Dashboard #
In this mini project I used a dataset and built a dashboard using Excel with different charts and filters to visualize the data.

 ### Data Cleaning
- Duplicated the dataset for preservation
-	Ensured that columns were transformed into their appropriate data types
-	Applied formatting to differentiate headers from the rest of the data


 ### Data Visualization 
-	Generated pivot tables for better data analysis
-	Designed charts corresponding to each pivot table
-	Implemented slicers to facilitate data filtering
